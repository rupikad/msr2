    "Most research questions that require software repository data cannot be answered with a simple API query, which is where quantitative analysis techniques for data wrangling take over. Please continue to use the `miner-utils` Python library ([link](https://github.com/EPICLab/miner-utils)), and answer the following questions using Python code in the empty code boxes below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is most easily accomplished using the [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library. We have included the following resources on Canvas to assist you:\n",
    "* [Tutorial: Data Wrangling with Pandas](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1793778/pages/tutorial-data-wrangling-with-pandas)\n",
